An eentsy-teensy turing-complete programming language that isn't a brainfuck to code in ;)
I designed this to be as usable as possible, while also being as minimal as possible.
As of the first version, it is 84 lines (in a semi-minified format), and has variables, expressions, and booleans.
The default environment is a REPL, but you can also load a program from a file.
Usage:
tiny [program] 
There are comments, but they take up entire an entire line, you can't use comments mid-line.
The example program that calculates factorials is at factorial.ty

--- BASICS ---

To define a variable:
foo = 9 

You can also define a variable as an expression:
; foo = 7
foo = + 2 5 

You can also define a variable as a boolean expression:
foo = == 1 1 
; true

You can use variables within expressions:
foo = 5
bar = 6
baz = + foo bar
; baz = 11

To go to line x if variable y is true (x can be a variable):
goto x y

To print variable x:
print x

To get a number as input and store it in variable x:
input x
